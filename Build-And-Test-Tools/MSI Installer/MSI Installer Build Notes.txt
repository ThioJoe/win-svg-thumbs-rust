Requires Wix toolset:
	https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix/releases

To automatically build the MSI installer with the version parsed from cargo.toml, just run the "Build MSI Installer.bat" batch file.



Or to build manually, run this command to build the MSI installer, replacing with whatever actual version:
	wix build win_svg_thumbs.wxs -d ProductVersion="1.0.0.0" -arch x64 -ext WixToolset.UI.wixext


Notes: 
	- It expects the DLL to be two levels up then in "target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\win_svg_thumbs.dll". To change the path of the DLL relative to the .wxs file, open the .wxs file and change the "DllSourcePath" value near the top.
